# Predicting NBA Game Winners

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the winners of NBA games. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and predictions based on historical NBA game data.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering to improve model performance
- Implementation of various machine learning models
- Performance evaluation and model comparison
- Predictions and insights from the model

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NBA-Game-Winner-Prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd NBA-Game-Winner-Prediction
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Workshoop1_Lab1_Predicting_NBA_Game_Winners-4.ipynb
```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.

## Data
The dataset used for this project includes historical NBA game data. It contains features such as team statistics, player performances, and other game-related metrics. Ensure that the dataset is correctly loaded before running the notebook.

## Model Performance
Multiple models are tested, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

The model with the best accuracy and generalization ability is selected for final predictions.

## Results
The final model provides accurate predictions of NBA game outcomes based on historical data. The key insights and performance metrics are documented within the notebook.
